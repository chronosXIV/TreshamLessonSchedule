# TreshamLessonSchedule
AQA Computing Practical Project 2014-2015

This was a complex programming project that involved data processing. For this project I taught myself PHP, SQL and HTML&CSS. It is a lesson schedule for the students and staff of Tresham College.

The report and the code can be both found in the Tresham Project.docx file.
